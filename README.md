# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```sh
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> This project is locked to the Bun package manager. Installs with npm, pnpm, or yarn will fail the `preinstall` check.

## PWA setup

- Manifest is generated by `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` with the app identity `pwa-shell` (description: `starting point for pwa apps.`), `start_url` `/`, `display` `standalone`, and dark theme/background colors `#0b0f1a`.
- Placeholder icons live in `static/icons` (`pwa-192.png`, `pwa-512.png`, `pwa-maskable-512.png`) and are wired into the manifest; replace them with your own artwork when ready.
- Service worker registration is auto-injected and set to `autoUpdate`, with dev mode enabled so you can test PWA behavior while running `bun run dev`.
- Offline fallback and runtime caching policies are not yet defined; add them later in `vite.config.ts` via the PWA plugin options when requirements are known.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
